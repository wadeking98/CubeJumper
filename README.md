# SideScroller

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.8.

## Controls

Side scroller consists of 3 powerups: double jump, pulse, extra life. To use double jump simply hit space bar again while airborne. To use pulse press "Z" on your keyboard. An extra life gets used each time you hit an obstacle, if you run out of lives the game ends.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
